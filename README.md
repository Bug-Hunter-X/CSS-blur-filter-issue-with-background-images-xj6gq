# CSS Blur Filter Issue with Background Images

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `filter: blur()` property in CSS with background images. In some browsers and scenarios, the blur effect might be weak or entirely absent, leading to unexpected visual results.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution to enhance the blur visibility and consistency across different browsers and devices.  This solution might involve adjusting the blur radius or using alternative techniques depending on the specific requirements and the complexity of the background image.
